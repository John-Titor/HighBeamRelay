High-beam switching relay, suitable for low/high 
beam switching with aftermarket Bi-Xenon headlights 
in older VW/Porsche applications.

The unit should be powered from the low-beam light 
power, and the IN pin pulled to ground by the high-beam
switch. The OUT pin should be connected to the positive
terminal of the Bi-Xenon high-beam solenoids.

If the IN pin is pulled briefly to ground, a 250ms flash
followed by a 250ms off period will be generated. If the
pin is held to ground for more than 350ms, the relay will
latch on and remain on until the IN pin is disconnected
from ground and then reconnected.
